Key Concepts Explored
1. The CIA Triad

Confidentiality: Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access (e.g., banking encryption).


Integrity: Ensuring data remains accurate and has not been tampered with.


Availability: Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed by authorized users.

2. Attackers & Threat Actors
Researched various threat actors including Script Kiddies, Insiders, Hacktivists, and Nation-State Actors.

3. Attack Surface Mapping
Identified vulnerabilities across Web Applications, Mobile Apps, APIs, and Cloud Infrastructure.

Mapped common apps like Email, WhatsApp, and Banking Apps to potential security risks.

4. Vulnerability Research
Analyzed the OWASP Top 10 to understand the most critical web application security risks and why they are dangerous.

Deliverables

Cybersecurity Foundation Report: A document explaining the CIA triad, attacker types, and attack surfaces.


Data Flow Analysis: Documentation of data moving from User → Application → Server → Database.
